        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: I was born in Michigan. I later moved to Illinois. I have also lived in Missouri and India. I moved to North Carolina in 2019. I live in Apex and attend UNCC. </li>
            <li>Professional: My first job was at cold stone when I was a junior in high school. I later quit because I had too much homework. Since then, I have interned at IBM and Wells Fargo. </li>
            <li>Academic background: I am currently a junior at UNCC. I am pursuing a bachelor of science in computer science. I am concentrating in cyber security and am minoring in data science. </li>
            <li>Background: I was introduced to computer science in an introduction to python programming class in high school. I fell in love with programming and decided to pursue it as a career. Both my parents are also software engineers, so they also influenced my interest.</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: My operating system is macOS Monterey. I have very limited experience with other operating systems. Although, I do have some experience with Windows. </li>
            <li>Courses I am taking: 
                <ul>
                    <li>ITCS3160 - Database Design & Implem - Focused on relational databases, SQL, data modeling, optimization, and non-relational databases. I will need to learn about databases to hold a career dealing with data. </li>
                    <li>ITIS3135 - Web App Design & Development - Learning about the components of web applications, designing webpages using guidelines, using a scripting language, exchanging data between web pages and web servers, and presenting a developed interactive web application. I need this class as it is very important to the field of cybersecurity. </li>
                    <li>ITIS3200 - Intro to Info Security & Priv - Basic concepts in computer security, mitigation techniques in different cyber-domains, learning about authentication and access control, cloud security, and cryptography. I need this course to introduce myself to my concentration. </li>
                    <li>ITSC3146 - Intro Operating Systems & Networking - Fundamentals of operating systems, basics of networking and communications. Covers processes, cache, memory management, and protocols. It is important to learn about operating systems if you will be working on them in your career. </li>
                    <li>ITIS3155 - Software Engineering - Learning about version control, programming concepts in python, data manipulation, agile methodology, front-end, testing, and user authentication. This course name is literally the name of the career I want. I better pay attention in this class, plus the concepts are very interesting.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story:
                When I was a kid (like in the second grade), my mom didn't let me watch PBS kids after school. So I called 911. The police later called back and she made me apologize to them for wasting their time. </li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I want to learn how to skateboard or play the guitar. How about both actually? </li>
        </ul>
